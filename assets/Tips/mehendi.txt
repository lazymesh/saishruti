    Make sure your skin is clean, without traces of oils, lotions or potions. Products will create a barrier between your skin and your mehendi.

    Visit the toilet before you begin (this probably won't make your mehendi darker, it's just tricky to visit the restroom once you're in the middle of the application)

    Once the paste is applied, it will dry quickly. To keep it moist and avoid cracks in your design, carefully dab lemon juice or sugar water (dissolve sugar in warm water) on the paste with cotton wool.

    Leave the paste on for as long as possible, ideally for six hours or more.

    Heat helps the colour develop, so keep warm.

    Once the paste has been rubbed off, apply vicks vapour rub or beesbax balm all over your design. This helps the colour develop from bright orange to deep red.

    Make sure everyone knows that you are exempt from housework of any kind for twenty four hours (or as longer if possible, see what you can get away with).

    Don't bathe for twenty four hours, this one can be tricky, especially if you are stinky, so try and have a bath just before your mehendi is applied. You simply cannot get your mehendi wet, I was caught in a monsoon just after I rubbed off my paste, so I had to frantically run home!

    When you finally do have a wash because you cannot stand your own stench any longer, apply Vaseline (petroleum jelly) to your design for protection.
